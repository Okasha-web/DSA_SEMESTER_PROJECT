Team Member 1: [Aneela Sarwar]
Contribution: Focused on the core Data Structure implementation, specifically the Linked List logic for snake movement and collision detection.
Learning: I gained a deep understanding of how pointers work in real-time scenarios and how to manage dynamic memory to avoid crashes.
Improvement Idea: If I had one more week, I would implement a "Save Game" feature using File Handling to store high scores.

Team Member 2: [Muhammad Okasha]
Contribution: Worked on code modularization, cleaning up global variables, and preparing the final documentation.
Learning: Learned how to structure a project professionally for GitHub and the importance of "Modular Programming."
Improvement Idea: I would add different difficulty levels where the snake's speed increases as the score goes up.
